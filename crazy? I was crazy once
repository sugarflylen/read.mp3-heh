✯⁠ .ೃ࿔ other than that that you're free to int!
 
if you know : nso , mlp , pmmm , hb , hh , bs , crk , dw , lacey's games, sanrio , etc. - ABSOLUTELY INT :D

note #1: (pony town:) best to dni if I'm with my friend, as she speaks polish and I may not be able to talk with you at the same time, so you might feel ignored /gen.
if I ever leave pt randomly, it's either bc of my internet or my battery died. 
note #2: use tonetags/indicators if your sentence is most likely to be interpreted the wrong way.
note #3: I think that's all :3
